# Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED: Simplified Agent Orchestrator

### What Was Built
A dramatically simplified multi-agent orchestration system in **~500 lines of code** (down from ~5000).

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. Task Queue (`src/core/task_queue.py`)
- ✅ SQLite-based task storage
- ✅ Priority levels (HIGH, NORMAL, LOW)
- ✅ Task status tracking
- ✅ Agent type affinity
- ✅ Statistics and cleanup

#### 2. Agent Spawner (`src/core/agent_spawner.py`)
- ✅ Direct subprocess.Popen() for CLI tools
- ✅ Support for claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- ✅ Support for codex with `--sandbox danger-full-access`
- ✅ Process monitoring and termination
- ✅ Output capture to files

#### 3. Context Manager (`src/core/context_manager.py`)
- ✅ File-based context sharing in `/tmp/agent_orchestrator/`
- ✅ Task contexts and agent outputs
- ✅ Shared documents between agents
- ✅ Message broadcasting system
- ✅ Context statistics and cleanup

#### 4. Task Decomposer (`src/core/task_decomposer.py`) - **NEW!**
- ✅ Intelligent task breakdown using Claude CLI
- ✅ Automatic subtask generation from high-level prompts
- ✅ Smart agent assignment (claude for design, codex for implementation)
- ✅ Fallback heuristic patterns for common tasks
- ✅ Execution phase planning

#### 5. CLI Interface (`src/cli/orchestrate.py`)
- ✅ `submit` - Add tasks to queue (with `--decompose` flag for auto-breakdown)
- ✅ `run` - Process tasks with multiple agents
- ✅ `status` - View queue and agent status
- ✅ `task` - View task details
- ✅ `agents` - List active agents
- ✅ `kill` - Terminate stuck agents
- ✅ `cleanup` - Remove old data
- ✅ `demo` - Run demonstration

### What Was Removed
- ❌ Redis and RQ workers
- ❌ FastAPI web server
- ❌ React dashboard
- ❌ Complex provider routing (8 providers)
- ❌ Git worktrees and auto-rebase
- ❌ Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- ❌ Systemd timers
- ❌ Session management
- ❌ WebSocket communication
- ❌ Complex configuration files

### Current Status

#### Working Features
- Task submission with priorities
- Multi-agent parallel execution
- Direct CLI subprocess spawning
- File-based context sharing
- Simple SQLite persistence
- CLI-based monitoring

#### Known Limitations
- No web UI (by design)
- No persistent agent sessions
- No complex task dependencies
- Basic round-robin distribution
- No git integration

### How to Use

```bash
# Method 1: Submit individual tasks
./orchestrate submit "Fix bug" --agent claude --priority high
./orchestrate submit "Update UI" --agent codex

# Method 2: Submit high-level task with auto-decomposition (NEW!)
./orchestrate submit "Build a todo app with authentication" --decompose

# Run orchestrator
./orchestrate run --max-agents 3

# Check status
./orchestrate status
```

### File Locations

**New Simplified System:**
- `/orchestrate` - Main entry point
- `/src/core/` - Core components
- `/src/cli/` - CLI interface
- `/tasks.db` - SQLite database

**Archived Old System:**
- `/archive/current_implementation_2025_01_28/` - All old code

### Documentation Updated
- ✅ README.md - Complete rewrite for new system
- ✅ CLAUDE.md - Updated with new commands
- ✅ QUICK_START.md - New user guide
- ✅ IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md - This file
- ✅ specs/SIMPLIFIED_ORCHESTRATION_SPECS.md - Marked as IMPLEMENTED

### Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Add terminal UI (TUI) for better visualization
2. Implement task dependencies
3. Add agent specialization routing
4. Create performance metrics
5. Add WebSocket monitoring (if needed)

### Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ Core system < 1000 lines (actual: ~500 lines)
- ✅ No external service dependencies
- ✅ Single command operation
- ✅ Support for 3+ parallel agents
- ✅ 5-minute setup time
- ✅ CLI-first interface

### Conclusion
The simplified system is **fully implemented and functional**. It does exactly what was requested:
- Local head node manages tasks
- Spawns separate codex/claude CLI instances
- Each agent works on assigned tasks
- Context shared via filesystem
- Simple, maintainable, effective

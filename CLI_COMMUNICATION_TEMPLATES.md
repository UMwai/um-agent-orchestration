### Technical Deep Dive Report Template

**Recipients**: Technical team, Architects, Technical Management
**Frequency**: Weekly (Fridays after standup)
**Format**: Technical document with code samples and metrics

```
# CLI Integration Technical Report - Week X

## Architecture Decisions Made

### TaskState Consolidation Decision
**Decision**: Create single enum in orchestrator/models/states.py
**Rationale**: Eliminate import conflicts and provide single source of truth
**Impact**: Positive - reduces complexity, improves maintainability
**Code Sample**:
```python
class TaskState(str, Enum):
    PENDING = "pending"
    RUNNING = "running" 
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    # ... other states
```

### Authentication Retry Strategy
**Decision**: Exponential backoff with circuit breaker
**Rationale**: Prevent infinite loops while allowing transient failures
**Impact**: Improved reliability and resource usage
**Implementation**: 3 retries max, 1s/2s/4s backoff, 30s circuit breaker

## Code Quality Metrics

### Test Coverage Analysis
```
Module                     Coverage    Lines   Missing

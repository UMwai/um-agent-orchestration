## Usage Examples

### Submitting Full Access Tasks

```bash
# Submit infrastructure task
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @examples/infra-prod-task.yaml

# Submit with explicit full access via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "id": "CUSTOM-FULL-ACCESS-001",
    "title": "Custom Full Access Task", 
    "description": "Task requiring unrestricted development access",
    "role": "backend",
    "full_access": true,
    "provider_override": "claude_interactive",
    "acceptance": {
      "tests": [],
      "lint": true,
      "typecheck": true
    },
    "target_dir": "."
  }'
```

### Monitoring Full Access Tasks

```bash
# Check task status
curl http://localhost:8000/tasks/INFRA-PROD-001

# Monitor git branches for full access tasks
git branch -a | grep auto/ | grep -E "(infra|migration|optimization)"

# View logs for full access task execution
tail -f logs/orchestrator.log | grep "INFRA-PROD-001"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Full Access Sparingly
Only enable full access for tasks that genuinely require system-level operations or unrestricted file access.

### 2. Choose the Right Provider
- **Claude Interactive** (`claude_interactive`) - Better for architectural decisions and complex reasoning
- **Codex Interactive** (`codex_interactive`) - Better for code generation and technical implementation

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
Always include thorough acceptance criteria for full access tasks since they can make significant system changes.

### 4. Monitor and Review
- Review git commits from full access tasks carefully
- Use worktrees to isolate full access task changes
- Enable branch protection rules for production environments

### 5. Environment Isolation  
Run full access tasks in development environments first before applying to staging/production.

## Troubleshooting Full Access Mode

### CLI Not Found
```bash
# Verify CLI installation
claude --version
codex --version

# Test full access flags
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "test"
codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox danger-full-access exec "test"
```

### Permission Denied
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la scripts/init-full-access.sh

# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/init-full-access.sh
```

### Task Stuck in Queue
```bash
# Check worker status
rq worker --url redis://localhost:6379

# Restart with full access provider order
# Edit config/config.yaml to ensure full_access_order is configured
```

Full access mode enables powerful autonomous development capabilities when used responsibly in appropriate environments.
